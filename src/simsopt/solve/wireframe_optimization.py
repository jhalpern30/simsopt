    """
    Optimizes the segment currents in a wireframe class instance.

    The `currents` field of the wireframe class instance will be updated with
    the solution.

    There are two different modes of operation depending on which optional
    input parameters are set:

      (1) The user supplies a target plasma boundary and, if needed, a constant
          external magnetic field; in this case, the function calculates the
          inductance matrix and required normal field at the test points
          in preparation for performing the least-squares solve. In this mode,
          the parameter `surf_plas` must be supplied and, if relevant, 
          `ext_field`.

      (2) The user supplies a pre-computed inductance matrix and vector with
          the required normal field on the plasma boundary, in which case it
          is not necessary to perform a field calculation before the least-
          squares solve. In this mode, the parameters `Amat` and `cvec` must
          be supplied.

    IMPORTANT: for Regularized Constrained Least Squares ('rcls') optimizations,
    the parameter `assume_no_crossings` MUST be set to True if the wireframe is 
    constrained to allow no crossing currents; otherwise, the optimization will 
    not work properly!

    Parameters
    ----------
        wframe: instance of the ToroidalWireframe class
            Wireframe whose segment currents are to be optimized
        algorithm: string
            Optimization algorithm to use. Options are:
                'rcls': Regularized Constrained Least Squares
                'gsco': Greedy Stellarator Coil Optimization
        params: dictionary
            Parameters for the optimization. See more detailed descriptions
            below.
        surf_plas: Surface class instance (optional)
            Surface of the target plasma, on which test points are placed for
            evaluation of the normal field. If supplied, a magnetic field
            calculation will be performed to determine the inductance matrix
            and target normal field vector prior to performing the least-
            squares solve as described in mode (1) above.
        ext_field: MagneticField class instance (optional)
            Constant external field assumed to be present in addition to the
            field produced by the wireframe. Used to calculate the target
            normal field vector in mode (1) as described above.
        bn_plas_curr: 1d double array (optional)
            Contributions of internal plasma currents to the normal field on
            the plasma boundary. Must have dimensions (nTestPoints, 1).   
        area_weighted: boolean (optional)
            Determines whether the inductance matrix and target normal field
            vector elements are weighted by the square root of the area 
            ascribed to each test point on the plasma boundary. If true, the
            weightings will be applied and therefore the optimization will 
            minimize the square integral of the normal field on the plasma 
            boundary. If false, the weightings will NOT be applied, and the
            optimization will minimize the sum of squares of the normal field
            at each test point. 
        Amat: 2d double array (optional)
            Inductance matrix relating normal field at test points on the
            plasma boundary to currents in each segment. This can be supplied
            along with `cvec` to skip the field calculation as describe in mode
            (2) above. Must have dimensions (nTestPoints, wFrame.nSegments), 
            where nTestPoints is the number of test points on the plasma 
            boundary. 
        cvec: double array (optional)
            Vector giving the target values of the normal field at each test
            point on the plasma boundary. This can be supplied along with `Amat`
            to skip the field calculation. Must have dimensions
            (nTestPoints, 1).
        verbose: boolean (optional)
            If true, will print progress to screen with durations of certain
            steps

    Parameters for RCLS optimizations
    ---------------------------------
        reg_lambda: scalar, 1d array, or 2d array
            Scalar, array, or matrix for regularization. If a 1d array, must
            have the same number of elements as wframe.nSegments. If a 2d 
            array, both dimensions must be equal to wframe.nSegments.
        assume_no_crossings: boolean (optional)
            If true, will assume that the wireframe is constrained such that
            its free segments form single-track loops with no forks or 
            crossings.  Default is False. 

    Parameters for GSCO optimizations
    ---------------------------------
        lambda_S: double
            Weighting factor for the objective function proportional to the
            number of active segments
        no_crossing: boolean
            If true, the solution will forbid currents from crossing within
            the wireframe 
        match_current: boolean
            If true, added loops of current will match the current of the 
            loop(s) adjacent to where they are added
        default_current: double
            Loop current to add during each iteration to empty loops or to any
            loop if not matching existing current
        max_current: double
            Maximum magnitude for the current in each segment
        nIter: integer
            Number of iterations to perform
        nHistory: integer
            Number of intermediate solutions to record, evenly spaced among the 
            iterations
        x_init: double array (optional)
            Initial values of the segment currents; zero by default
        loop_count_init: integer array (optional)
            Signed number of loops of current added to each loop in the 
            wireframe prior to the optimization (optimization will
            add to these numbers); zero by default
